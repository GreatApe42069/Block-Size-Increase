# Dogecoin Improvement Proposal (DOIP-XXXX):
**Block Size Increase:**
This proposal suggests increasing Dogecoin's block size to enhance scalability. The proposed changes are encapsulated in a C++

**Implementation Details:**
The DOIPXXXX class contains a method named ImplementBlockSizeIncrease, which accepts a Network object as a parameter. This method sets the block size to 8 megabytes, aiming to improve scalability.

**Usage:**
To apply this proposal, create an instance of the DOIPXXXX class and call the implementBlockSizeIncrease method with the initialized Network object. This should be executed in the main function.

# *Important Note:*
 ***These codes are untested and may require thorough testing and consideration before being implemented in a live environment.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GreatApe42069/Dogecoin_improvements/ImplementBlockSizeIncrease.cpp.git
